    "## Description of Terms\n",
    "Note: Units for flow are measured in MW. The following terms are descriptions of the time series. There are additional time series included which represent the carbon intensity forecast for 2023 of various regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- IFA_FLOW: IFA stands for Interconnexion France-Angleterre, which is a subsea electricity link between France and Great Britain that began operating in 1986. It's a joint venture between National Grid and the French Transmission Operator RTE. The system-to-system flow (SSF) of the IFA is calculated and adjusted for interconnector losses to determine the flow. \n",
    "- TSD: This is the Transmission System generation requirement and is equivalent to the Initial Transmission System Outturn (ITSDO) and Transmission System Demand Forecast on BM Reports. Transmission System Demand is equal to the ND plus the additional generation required to meet station load, pump storage pumping and interconnector exports.\n",
    "- VIKING_FLOW: Flow coming from a record-breaking 475-mile-long land and subsea cable connecting British and Danish energy grids for the first time.\n",
    "- IFA2_FLOW: Commissioned in 2021 IFA2 is a 1,000 MW high voltage direct current (HVDC) electrical interconnector between the British and French transmission systems. It is the second link to France that National Grid has developed with RTE.\n",
    "- EMBEDDED_WIND_GENERATION: This is an estimate of the GB wind generation from wind farms which do not have Transmission System metering installed. These wind farms are embedded in the distribution network and invisible to National Grid. Their effect is to suppress the electricity demand during periods of high wind. The true output of these generators is not known so an estimate is provided based on National Grid’s best model.\n",
    "- ND: This is the Great Britain generation requirement and is equivalent to the Initial National Demand Outturn (INDO) and National Demand Forecast as published on BM Reports. National Demand is the sum of metered generation, but excludes generation required to meet station load, pump storage pumping and interconnector exports. National Demand is calculated as a sum of generation based on National Grid operational generation metering. \n",
    "- MOYLE_FLOW: Flow related to The Moyle Interconnector, a 500 megawatt (MW) HVDC link between Scotland and Northern Ireland, running between Auchencrosh in Ayrshire and Ballycronan More in County Antrim. It went into service in 2001\n",
    "- NEMO_FLOW: Flow from Nemo Link, a 1,000 MegaWatt HVDC submarine power cable between Richborough Energy Park in Kent, the United Kingdom and Zeebrugge, Belgium\n",
    "- ELECLINK_FLOW: Flow from ElecLink, a 1,000 MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) electrical interconnector between the United Kingdom and France, passing through the Channel Tunnel.\n",
    "- PUMP_STORAGE_PUMPING: The demand due to pumping at hydro pump storage units; the -ve signifies pumping load.\n",
    "- EMBEDDED_WIND_CAPACITY: This is National Grid’s best view of the installed embedded wind capacity in GB. This is based on publically available information compiled from a variety of sources and is not the definitive view. It is consistent with the generation estimate provided above. \n",
    "- SETTLEMENT_DATE: Settlement Date. \n",
    "- ENGLAND_WALES_DEMAND: England and Wales Demand, as ND above but on an England and Wales basis.\n",
    "- EMBEDDED_SOLAR_CAPACITY: As embedded wind capacity above, but for solar generation.\n",
    "- SCOTTISH_TRANSFER: Power transfer across the scottish boundaries due to growth in renewable generation capacity.\n",
    "- NON_BM_STOR: Operating reserve for units that are not included in the ND generator definition. This can be in the form of generation or demand reduction.\n",
    "- SETTLEMENT_PERIOD: Settlement Period. \n",
    "- EAST_WEST_FLOW: Flow from the East - West Interconnector between Ireland and Great Britain.\n",
    "- NSL_FLOW: Flow from the North Sea Link (NSL), a joint venture with Norwegian system operator Statnett. Stretching 720 kilometres under the North Sea, at depths of up to 700 metres, NSL is an interconnector capable of sharing up to 1400 megawatts of electricity\n",
    "- BRITNED_FLOW: Flow from the Britned connector, a two-way 1,000 MW high-voltage direct current connection has a length of 260 km and runs from the Isle of Grain (in Kent) to Maasvlakte (near Rotterdam)\n",
    "- _ID: Line ID. \n",
    "- EMBEDDED_SOLAR_GENERATION: As embedded wind generation above, but for solar generation."
